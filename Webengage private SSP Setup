# Creating a Private SSP in WebEngage for CampaignHQ

This document explains how to create a **Private SSP (Server-Side Provider)** in WebEngage to integrate it with **CampaignHQ**.

A Private SSP enables secure, server-to-server communication where WebEngage can send events or data to CampaignHQ using authenticated requests.


## Prerequisites

* Access to the **WebEngage Dashboard**
* Access to the **CampaignHQ Dashboard**
* Permission to generate API keys in CampaignHQ


## Step 1: Navigate to SSP Configuration in WebEngage

In the WebEngage dashboard, go to:

Settings → Integrations → SSP → Add SSP

Select:

* **SSP Type:** Private SSP



## Step 2: Fill SSP Configuration Details

### SSP

* **Private SSP**

### Name Your Configuration

Use a clear and descriptive name:

* **CampaignHQ Private SSP**

(Optionally include environment info like `CampaignHQ – Prod` or `CampaignHQ – Staging`.)


### URL

Enter the CampaignHQ endpoint that will receive requests from WebEngage.

Example:

[https://api.campaignhq.co/webengage/ssp](https://api.campaignhq.co/webengage/ssp)

> Use the exact endpoint provided by CampaignHQ for WebEngage integration.

### Principal Entity ID

#### What is Principal Entity ID?

The **Principal Entity ID** represents the owning business entity or account in WebEngage under which this SSP operates. It is mainly used in enterprise or multi-entity WebEngage setups.

In simple terms, it tells WebEngage **which account or entity is allowed to use this SSP**.

#### When is it required?

* Multi-entity or multi-workspace WebEngage accounts
* Enterprise or partner-level integrations
* When WebEngage explicitly provides or mandates it

#### What should you enter?

* If WebEngage has provided a Principal Entity ID → enter it here
* If not provided or not required → **leave this field empty**

> For most standard WebEngage accounts, this field can be safely left blank.


## Step 3: Add Authorization Header

Click **Add Header** and configure the following:

### Header Key

Authorization

### Header Value

`<YOUR_CAMPAIGNHQ_API_KEY>`


## Step 4: Generate API Key in CampaignHQ

To generate the API key:

1. Go to
   [https://app.campaignhq.co/settings/integrations/api-keys/](https://app.campaignhq.co/settings/integrations/api-keys/)
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Copy the generated key
4. Paste it as the value for the `Authorization` header in WebEngage

This API key is used by CampaignHQ to authenticate requests coming from WebEngage.

## Step 5: Save the SSP

After filling all required details, click **Add SSP**.

Your Private SSP is now successfully configured.

## Summary

| Field               | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SSP Type            | Private SSP                            |
| Configuration Name  | CampaignHQ Private SSP                 |
| URL                 | CampaignHQ WebEngage SSP endpoint      |
| Principal Entity ID | Optional (leave empty unless provided) |
| Header              | Authorization: CampaignHQ API Key      |

## Best Practices

* Use separate API keys for staging and production
* Rotate API keys periodically for security
* Do not expose the SSP endpoint publicly
* Contact WebEngage support if Principal Entity ID is required later
